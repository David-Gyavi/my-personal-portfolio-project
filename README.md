#### Colors

I have decided to use some colors that fit well with the strong presentation of the portfolio.
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.

![Color Palette](wireframes/color_palette.png)

* #F8F9FA: I have decided to keep the background of the overall website white-Cultured in order give the clean look of the Site.
* #CED4DA: This color I will use as a background color for whole dashboard. 
* #6C757D: This color I will use as a background color for the logs on the dashboard in order to have a small contract versus #D9D9D9 dashboard color.
* #090A0B: This will be the color that I will use for my navigation bar and buttons in order to give a bit of color to the website. This color will also be used as the overall text color.

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable.
